Q: Get screen dimensions in pixels
I created some custom elements, and I want to programmatically place them to the upper right corner (n pixels from the top edge and m pixels from the right edge). Therefore I need to get the screen width and screen height and then set position: int px = screenWidth - m;int py = screenHeight - n; How do I get screenWidth and screenHeight in the main Activity?
