Q: Download a file with Android, and showing the progress in a ProgressDialog
I am trying to write a simple application that gets updated. For this I need a simple function that can download a file and show the current progress in a ProgressDialog. I know how to do the ProgressDialog, but I'm not sure how to display the current progress and how to download the file in the first place.
