Q: How to add manifest permission to android application?
I am trying to access http link using HttpURLConnection in Android to download a file, but getting this warning in LogCat: WARN/System.err(223): java.net.SocketException: Permission denied (maybe missing INTERNET permission) I have added android.Manifest.permission to my application but its still giving the same exception.
