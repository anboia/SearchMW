Q: “R cannot be resolved to a variable”? [duplicate]
This question already has an answer here: Developing for Android in Eclipse: R.java not generating 62 answers In Eclipse, I've created a project from a source and now it shows errors - "R cannot be resolved to a variable". From what I found here, I had cleared and rebuilt the project, but still the R file doesn't appear in the /gen folder. Any ideas?
