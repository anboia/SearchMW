Q: R cannot be resolved - Android error
I just downloaded and installed the new Android SDK. I wanted to create a simple application to test drive it. The wizard created this code: package eu.mauriziopz.gps;import android.app.Activity;import android.os.Bundle;public class ggps extends Activity {    /** Called when the activity is first created. */    @Override    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        setContentView(R.layout.main);    }} but Eclipse gives me the error R cannot be resolved on line setContentView(R.layout.main); Why? PS: I do have an XML file named main.xml under res/layout/.
