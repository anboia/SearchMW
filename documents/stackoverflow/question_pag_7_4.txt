Q: How to pause / sleep thread or process in Android?
I want to make a pause between two lines of code, Let me explain a bit: -> the user clicks a button (a card in fact) and I show it by changing the background of this button: thisbutton.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.icon); -> after let's say 1 second, I need to go back to the previous state of the button by changing back its background: thisbutton.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.defaultcard); -> I've tried to pause the thread between these two lines of code with: try {    Thread.sleep(1000);} catch (InterruptedException e) {    // TODO Auto-generated catch block    e.printStackTrace();} However, this does not work. Maybe it's the process and not the Thread that I need to pause? I've also tried (but it doesn't work): new Reminder(5); With this: public class Reminder {Timer timer;        public Reminder(int seconds) {            timer = new Timer();            timer.schedule(new RemindTask(), seconds*1000);        }        class RemindTask extends TimerTask {            public void run() {                System.out.format("Time's up!%n");                timer.cancel(); //Terminate the timer thread            }        }      } How can I pause/sleep the thread or process?
