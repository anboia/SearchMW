Q: How to hide the title bar for an Activity in XML with existing custom theme
I want to hide the titlebar for some of my activities. The problem is that I applied a style to all my activities, therefore I can't simply set the theme to @android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar. Using the NoTitleBar theme as a parent for my style would remove the title bar for to much activities. Can I set a no title style item somewhere?
