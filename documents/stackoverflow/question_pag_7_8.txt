Q: Setting background colour of Android layout element
I am trying to, somewhat clone the design of an activity from a set of slides on Android UI design. However I am having a problem with a very simple task. I have created the layout as shown in the image, and the header is a TextView in a RelativeLayout. Now I wish to change the background colour of the RelativeLayout, however I cannot seem to figure out how. I know I can set the android:background property in the RelativeLayout tag in the XML file, but what do I set it to? I want to define a new colour that I can use in multiple places. Is it a drawable or a string? Additionally I would expect there to be a very simple way to this from within the Eclipse Android UI designer that I must be missing? I am a bit frustrated currently, as this should be an activity that is performed with a few clicks at maximum. So any help is very appreciated. :)
