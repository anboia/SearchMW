Q: How to install Google Play Services in a Genymotion VM (with no drag and drop support)?
How can I install Google Play Services in a Genymotion emulator with no drag and drop support? I can't install it as mentioned in Stack Overflow post How do you install Google frameworks (Play, Accounts, etc.) on a Genymotion virtual device? due to the lack of support for drag and drop installation. Genymotion supports Google Apps for a few emulators, but it doesn't support tablet emulators.
