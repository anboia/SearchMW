Q: How to scale an Image in ImageView to keep the aspect ratio
In Android, I defined an ImageView's layout_width to be fill_parent (which takes up the full width of the phone). If the image I put to ImageView is bigger than the layout_width, Android will scale it, right? But what about the height? When Android scales the image, will it keep the aspect ratio? What I find out is that there is some white space at the top and bottom of the ImageView when Android scales an image which is bigger than the ImageView. Is that true? If yes, how can I eliminate that white space?
