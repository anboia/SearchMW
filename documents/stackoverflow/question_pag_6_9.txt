Q: How to run a Runnable thread in Android?
I developed one small application to display some text at defined intervals in the android emulator screen. I am using Handler class, small snippet from my code : handler = new Handler();Runnable r = new Runnable() {    public void run() {        tv.append("Hello World");                   }};handler.postDelayed(r, 1000); When i run this application the text is displayed only once. Please any one knows how to run a thread using Handler help me.
