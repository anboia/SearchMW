Q: Android screen size HDPI, LDPI, MDPI [duplicate]
This question already has an answer here: Android splash screen image sizes to fit all devices 5 answers I have a background that I need fit in all screen sizes. I have three folders, hdpi, ldpi and mdpi for drawables, but in the emulator there isn't any referense to what resolution hdpi is and what mdpi and ldpi are.
