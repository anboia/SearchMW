Q: how to display Alert Dialog in android?
I want to display dialog/popup window for message to user that shows "Are you sure you want to delete this entry?" with One button of 'Delete' . On click of button Delete, it should delete that entry otherwise nothing. I have written a click listener of those buttons but I dont know how to invoke dialog or popup and its functionality.
