Q: Saving Activity state in Android
I've been playing around with the Android SDK, and I am a little unclear on saving an application's state. So given this minor re-tooling of the 'Hello, Android' example: package com.android.hello;import android.app.Activity;import android.os.Bundle;import android.widget.TextView;public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {    /** Called when the activity is first created. */    @Override    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);        mTextView = new TextView(this);        if (savedInstanceState == null) {            mTextView.setText("Welcome to HelloAndroid!");        } else {            mTextView.setText("Welcome back.");        }        setContentView(mTextView);    }    private TextView mTextView = null;} I thought that might be all one needed to do for the simplest case, but it always gives me the first message, no matter how I navigate away from the app. I'm sure it's probably something simple like overriding onPause or something like that, but I've been poking away in the docs for 30 minutes or so and haven't found anything obvious, so would appreciate any help. Cue me looking a fool in three, two, one...
