Q: Stop EditText from gaining focus at Activity startup
I have an Android Activity, with two elements: EditText ListView When my Activity starts, the EditText immediately has input focus (flashing cursor). I don't want any control to have input focus at startup. I tried: EditText.setSelected(false); No luck. How can I convince the EditText to not select itself when the Activity starts?
