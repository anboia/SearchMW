Q: Android Drawing Separator/Divider Line in Layout?
I would like to draw a line right in the middle of a layout and use it as a separator of other items like TextView. Is there a good widget for this. I don't really want to use an image as it would be hard to match the other components to it. And I want it to be relatively positioned as well. Thanks
