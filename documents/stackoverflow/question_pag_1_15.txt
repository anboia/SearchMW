Q: Android - basic gesture detection
I want to get fling gesture detection working in my Android application. What I have is a GridLayout that contains 9 ImageViews. The source can be found here: Romain Guys's Grid Layout. That file is take from Romain Guy's Photostream application and has only been slightly adapted. For the simple click situation I need only set the onClickListener for each ImageView I add to be the main activity which implements View.OnClickListener. It seems infinitely more complicated to implement something that recognizes a fling. I presume this is because it may span views? If my activity implementsOnGestureListener I don't know how toset that as the gesture listener forthe Grid or the Image views that Iadd. public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements   View.OnClickListener, OnGestureListener { ... If my activity implementsOnTouchListener then I have noonFling method to override (it hastwo events as parameters allowing meto determine if the fling wasnoteworthy). public class SelectFilterActivity extends Activity implements    View.OnClickListener, OnTouchListener { ... If I make a custom View, like GestureImageView that extends ImageView I don't know how to tell the activity that a fling has occurred from the view. In any case, I tried this and the methods weren't called when I touched the screen. I really just need a concrete example of this working across views. What, when and how should I attach this listener? I need to be able to detect single clicks also. // Gesture detectionmGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener() {    public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) {        int dx = (int) (e2.getX() - e1.getX());        // don't accept the fling if it's too short        // as it may conflict with a button push        if (Math.abs(dx) > MAJOR_MOVE && Math.abs(velocityX) > Math.absvelocityY)) {            if (velocityX > 0) {                moveRight();            } else {                moveLeft();            }            return true;        } else {            return false;        }    }}); Is it possible to lay a transparent view over the top of my screen to capture flings? If I choose not to inflate my child image views from XML can I pass the GestureDetector as a constructor parameter to a new subclass of ImageView that I create? This is the very simple activity that I'm trying to get the fling detection to work for: SelectFilterActivity (Adapted from photostream). I've been looking at these sources: Detect Gestures - Tutorial SDK docs Calculator Code Nothing has worked for me so far and I was hoping for some pointers.
