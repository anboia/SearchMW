Q: Make an HTTP request with android
I have searched everywhere but I couldn't find my answer, is there a way to make an simple HTTP request? I want to request an PHP page / script on one of my website but I don't want to show the webpage. If possible I even want to do it in the background (in an BroadcastReceiver)
