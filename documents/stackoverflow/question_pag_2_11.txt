Q: Is there a way to get the source code from an APK file? [closed]
The hard drive on my laptop just crashed and I lost all the source code for an app that I have been working on for the past two months.All I have is the APK file that is stored in my email from when I sent it to a friend. Is there any way to extract my source code from this APK file?
